/**
With traditional unit tests it is hard to come up with good data that actually exposes bugs,
especially the unexpected kind of bugs that only seem to creep up in production.
Using ScalaCheck we can let the computer come up with random data to test our code.
ScalaCheck includes standard generators for the usual suspects such as Int, String, etc.
Itâ€™s also easy to add and use custom generators for existing or new data types.

ScalaCheck is not a replacement for traditional tests. Explicit examples are still useful
as documentation and we should also add a test to the above code to ensure an exception
is thrown when we try to serialize a String that is not valid Unicode, as our proposition
only tests the behavior for valid Strings. But ScalaCheck based testing can help us find
those unexpected bugs (really, the most common kind) before they get into production code.
Trying to find the silent corruption bug of the first few serialization attempts would
be a lot harder in a production environment.
